M = number of Nodes 
N = number of Edges  

- AIDS_A.TXT = Adjacency Matrix, but is N*2 where N is the number of labels  and not M*M where M is the number of nodes (easier to compile)
- AIDS_EDGE_LABELS = Labeling for each edge, the matrix is N*1 and the labels can only be part of the set {1,2,3}
- AIDS_GRAPH_LABELS  = ???
- AIDS_GRAPH_INDICATOR = ???
- AIDS_NODE_ATTRIBUTES = x matrix, all the values for each node, 4 attributes for each node
